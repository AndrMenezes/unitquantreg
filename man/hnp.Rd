\value{
A list with the following components in ordered
(and absolute if \code{halfnormal} is \code{TRUE}) values:
\item{obs}{the observed residuals.}

\description{
Produces a (half-)normal probability plot from a fitted model
object of class \code{\link{unitquantreg}}.

\details{
Residuals plots with simulated envelope were proposed by Atkinson (1981)
and can be construct as follows:

\enumerate{
\item{generate sample set of \eqn{n} independent observations from the estimated
parameters of the fitted model;}
\item{fit the model using the generated sample, if \code{halfnormal} is
\code{TRUE} compute the absolute values of the residuals and arrange them in order;}
\item{repeat steps (1) and (2) \code{nsim} number of times;}
\item{consider the \eqn{n} sets of the \code{nsim} ordered statistics
of the residuals, then for each set compute the quantile \code{level}/2,
the median and the quantile 1 - \code{level}/2;}
\item{plot these values and the ordered residuals of the original sample set
versus the expected order statistics of a (half)-normal distribution,
which is approximated as}
\deqn{G^{-1} \left(\frac{i + n - 0.125}{2n + 0.5} \right)}
for half-normal plots, i.e., \code{halfnormal=TRUE} or
\deqn{G^{-1} \left(\frac{i - 0.375}{n + 0.25}\right)}
for normal plots, i.e., \code{halfnormal=FALSE}, where \eqn{G(\cdot)} is the the
cumulative distribution function of standard Normal distribution for
\code{quantile} residuals or the standard exponential distribution for the
\code{cox-snell} residuals.
}

According to Atkinson (1981), if the model was correctly specified then no
more than \code{level}100\% of the observations are expected to appear
outside the envelope bands. Additionally, if a large proportion of the
observations lies outside the envelope, thus one has evidence against
the adequacy of the fitted model.
